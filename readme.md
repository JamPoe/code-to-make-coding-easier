# SimpleScript

Why hello there. This here is an experiment of mine to:

1. Learn jQuery, by analyzing it's methods and functions and attempting to recreate them

2. Make my and other's code easier to do

This project is still in its early beginnings, but I plan make this a useful utility for my learning and coding benefit.
