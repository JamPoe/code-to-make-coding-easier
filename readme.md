# Simple JS Experiment

Why hello there. This here is an experiment of mine to:

1. Learn how jQuery and other JS libraries work by analyzing it's methods and functionalities and attempting to recreate them from scratch for learning purposes

2. Make my and others' code easier to do

This project is still in its early beginnings, but I plan make this a useful utility for my learning and coding benefit.
